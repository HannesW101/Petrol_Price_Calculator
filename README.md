Program used to calculate the cost of a trip in a certain car travelling a certain distance (in km) using the current prices for fuel.

The option to choose your car make and model is based on a CSV data set of common cars in America from years 2000-2022

The fuel prices are updated each time the application is run and the application retrieves this information from the API called Fuel SA API which is found here https://www.fuelsa.co.za/ (Note you will need your own API key for this application, they have a 14 day free trial)

Example outputs of the program running below:
